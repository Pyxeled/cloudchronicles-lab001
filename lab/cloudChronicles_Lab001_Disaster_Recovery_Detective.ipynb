    "\n",
    "**Situation:**  \n",
    "As a Cloud Architect for QuickCart a small but growing e-commerce startup. QuickCart's entire application (web front-end, order processing, and product database) is hosted in Google Cloud's `us-central1` region. The application uses:\n",
    "*   Google Compute Engine (GCE) instances for the web servers and application logic.\n",
    "*   Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL for the product catalog and customer orders.\n",
    "*   Cloud Storage for product images.\n",
    "A critical regional outage has just been reported by Google Cloud for `us-central1`, making all QuickCart services inaccessible. The CEO is asking for an immediate plan to get the store back online.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:**  \n",
    "The task is to outline a basic disaster recovery (DR) plan using the STAR method. This plan should define how QuickCart can failover its critical services to a designated backup region (`us-east1`) using appropriate Google Cloud tools. The goal is to restore service with minimal data loss and downtime, considering QuickCart's current (simplified) infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Action:**  \n",
    "To complete this task, this will be needed:\n",
    "1.  **Identify Critical Services:** List the core components of QuickCart that need to be recovered (e.g., database, web servers, image storage).\n",
    "2.  **Choose DR Strategies:** For each critical service, select a suitable Google Cloud DR strategy/tool.\n",
    "    *Consider Cloud SQL's replication features.\n",
    "    *Think about Cloud Storage's regional/multi-regional capabilities.\n",
    "    *How can you quickly deploy GCE instances in a new region? (Think Instance Templates, Managed Instance Groups).\n",
    "    *How will users reach the application in the new region? (Think Load Balancing).\n",
    "    *How would you know to trigger the DR plan?\n",
    "3.  **Outline Failover Steps:** Briefly describe the sequence of actions to activate the DR site (e.g., promote database replica, deploy compute, update DNS/Load Balancer).\n",
    "4.  **Define Key Metrics:** While you won't calculate them, think about what Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) would mean for QuickCart.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Result:**  \n",
    "A documented disaster recovery outline using the STAR method format provided below. This plan should clearly state the primary and backup regions, failover triggers, redundancy services chosen for QuickCart's components, and a conceptual backup/replication strategy."
