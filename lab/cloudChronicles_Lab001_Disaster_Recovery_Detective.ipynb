    "**Situation:**  \n",
    "You are a Cloud Architect for \"QuickCart,\" a small but growing e-commerce startup. QuickCart's entire application (web front-end, order processing, and product database) is hosted in Google Cloud's `us-central1` region. The application uses:\n",
    "*   Google Compute Engine (GCE) instances for the web servers and application logic.\n",
    "*   Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL for the product catalog and customer orders.\n",
    "*   Cloud Storage for product images.\n",
    "A critical regional outage has just been reported by Google Cloud for `us-central1`, making all QuickCart services inaccessible. The CEO is asking for an immediate plan to get the store back online.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:**  \n",
    "Your task is to outline a basic disaster recovery (DR) plan using the STAR method. This plan should define how QuickCart can failover its critical services to a designated backup region (`us-east1`) using appropriate Google Cloud tools. The goal is to restore service with minimal data loss and downtime, considering QuickCart's current (simplified) infrastructure.\n",
